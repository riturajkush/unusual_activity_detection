# Unusual acitivity detetection


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Running this project on your local system requires the following packages to be installed :

* numpy
* matplotlib
* sklearn
* PIL
* cv2
* keras 
* face_detection
* face_recognition
* tqdm

They can be installed from the Python Package Index using pip as follows :
 
     pip install numpy
     pip install matplotlib
     pip install sklearn
     pip install Pillow
     pip install opencv-python
     pip install Keras
     pip install git+https://github.com/hukkelas/DSFD-Pytorch-Inference.git
     pip install face-recognition
     pip install tqdm
     
You can also use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) in a Web Browser with most of the libraries preinstalled.
 
### Usage
This project is implemented using interactive Jupyter Notebooks. 


## Tools Used
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) : Used for storing and manipulating high dimensional arrays.
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) : Used for plotting.
* [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) : Used for DBSCAN clustering.
* [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) : Used for manipulating images.
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) : Used for manipulating images and video streams.
* [Keras](https://keras.io/) : Used for designing and training the Face_Mask_Classifier model.
* [face-detection](https://github.com/hukkelas/DSFD-Pytorch-Inference) : Used for detecting faces with Dual Shot Face Detector.
* [face-recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) : Used for detecting facial landmarks.
* [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) : Used for showing progress bars.
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) : Used as the developement environment for executing high-end computations on its backend GPUs/TPUs and for editing Jupyter Notebooks.
